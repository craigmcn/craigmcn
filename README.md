### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Front-end web developer excited about creating helpful applications built on microservices to save users time and money.


## About me
Iâ€™m a highly proficient web developer and technical writer. Iâ€™m primarily self-trained as a web developer, and have worked as a web publisher within a large corporation and as software developer within large, Canadian universities and public sector organizations. I received my technical writing certificate from Humber College in Toronto.

As a software developer, I specialize in small- to medium-sized websites, best suited for home or small businesses, community organizations, or individuals. I work from a specified design and focus on creating the necessary functionality and usability. While I designed my own websites, including creating all the necessary graphics, Iâ€™m much more capable of making a website perform as intended than I am at making it look pretty. I worked as senior web publisher within the internal documentation department of CIBC, while also working on a number of personal projects. I've worked for the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Victoria, maintaining websites, web applications and web-based reporting systems. Currently, Iâ€™m a user interface developer for EducationPlannerBC, working in React-Redux with REST microservices.

As a technical writer, I write and edit to create clear and concise procedural, how-to documents. I specialize in computer software and hardware, and financial services processes. I perform an audience analysis to determine my stakeholders, create an overview of the necessary procedures, and then work with subject matter experts to develop the appropriate content. I manage my part of the project to ensure it is on track and on schedule with any other related work. I enjoy designing effective templates for print and online user guides, and writing blogs, news messages and other intranet content or business communication. I am also skilled at writing and developing business or technical presentations.

Specialties: standards-compliant HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript (React, Redux, jQuery); online documentation and communication; content management; MySQL and SQL Server
